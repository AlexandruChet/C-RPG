# 🎯 My C++ Learning Journey

This repository is created for my learning of **C++**, one of the most powerful programming languages.
This is where I keep all my projects, code examples, exercises, and experiments, divided by topic.

---

## 📂 Repository structure
There are many folders inside, and each of them is dedicated to a separate topic or concept of C++:
- **basics/** — variables, data types, operators, input/output
- **conditions/** — `if`, `else`, `switch` operators
- **loops/** — `for`, `while`, `do...while` loops
- **arrays/** — one-dimensional and multidimensional arrays
- **functions/** — creating and calling functions
- **pointers/** — pointers, addresses, dereferencing
- **strings/** — working with strings (`std::string`, character arrays)
- **structures/** — structures, `typedef`, nested structures
- **OOP/** — object-oriented programming: classes, constructors, inheritance
- **files/** — working with files (`fstream`, reading/writing data)
- **projects/** — small programs that combine several topics

---

## 💡 Goal
- Master **all basic and advanced C++ concepts**
- Learn **to read and write efficient code**
- Understand how **memory, pointers, classes, and objects** work
- Create your own **mini-projects** for practice

---

## 🧠 Tools used
- **Compiler:** g++
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
- **OS:** Windows 10
- **Console encoding:** UTF-8 (`SetConsoleOutputCP(CP_UTF8)`)

---

## 🚀 How to run the code
1. Open the desired folder with the topic
2. Open the `.cpp` file
3. Compile in the terminal:
```bash
g++ -o program.exe file.cpp
````

4. Run:

```bash
./program.exe
```
